# Programming Language for Drawing

Drawing pictures can be done using a variety of programming languages. 
Drawing functions are supported by calling library functions in some 
general-purpose languages (e.g., C++ and Java). 
Specialized programming languages, on the other hand, such as Logo, have built-in drawing keywords and syntax.
The aim of this project is to create and introduce a new drawing programming language.

## Getting Started

1. Start by downloading the project.
2. Navigate through "...\sablecc" folder.
3. Execute "java -jar sablecc-3.2/lib/sablecc.jar sablecc-3.2/grammar_draw.txt" in the command line.
4. Execute "cd sablecc-3.2" in the command line.
5. Execute "javac assignlang/Compiler.java" in the command line.
6. Execute "java assignlang.Compiler input_draw.txt" in the command line.
7. Exit the canvas page to finish the execution.
7. Execute "cd .." if any change is being made on the "SemanticAnalyzer.java" and repeat the step 3.

### Prerequisites
